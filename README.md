- Diabetes is among one of the most common and critical diseases and lots of people suffer from this disease yearly. Various factors such as weight, inherited diabetes, lack 
of exercise and eating habits results in Diabetes. If diabetes is undiagnosed and its progression is not maintained it can result in fatal compromise of vital organs of human body. Therefore timely detection of diabetes is very important for diabetes patients. Current practice in hospitals is to collect required information through a series of test and then diagnose the disease and proposed a treatment. Machine learning can be used to study the hospitals dataset volumes and can play a significant part in healthcare industry. Machine learning is widely used for diabetes detection and diagnosis however it can also be used for monitoring the progression of diabetes.  we have proposed a machine learning model for detecting diabetes and predicting the progression of diabetes in patients through multiple daily glucose level reading of patients .The parameter of datasets include age, gender, fasting reading, pre meal reading, and post meal reading. A parameter of HBA1C reading is included for prediction of prediabetes. Medication, Exercise and Carbohydrates parameters assist in predicting the progression of diabetes patients.
